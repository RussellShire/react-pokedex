A Pokedex with basic info for each Pokemon that is both searchable and filterable.

# Hosted

https://russellshire.github.io/react-pokedex/

# Project specifications

- Using the pokeapi to get data
- Calls to the api should be minimal
- Users can hover over a pokemon to reveal more information about them
- Users can search for a pokemon name to filter the pokemon on display
- Users can filter pokemon by their type
- Search and filter can be performed at the same time
- More filters can be added at a later date
- No libraries or depencancies should be added except React and pokeapi

# Optional To Do:

- Rename filters
- Add second dropdown for another filter
- Clean up scroll event listener
- Make event listener fire without scroll
- Filter out pokemon from end of pokedex that are region specific or cosplay types
- Fix UI bug where pokemon names over two lines become left aligned
- Add comma between Types when there are multiple types
- Sometimes images do not load (especially back images), make so they don't show broken if they haven't loaded. Seems to be some back images are null
